# Carefree
Many people want to bike more often. Biking through cities is cheaper, reduces your emissions, is more pleasant, and allows you to enjoy city life more.

However, fear of being hit by a car is a big deterrence.

Carefree helps alleviate this fear by giving users safer routes through cities.

This is a project using state (Massachusetts DOT) data, Open Street Maps, and potentially Somerville city data to make an app that gives users safe alternative routes through the city of Somerville, MA. 

See the About page for more details.
